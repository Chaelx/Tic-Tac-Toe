Research and notes
==================

* Combination js front-end + ajax calls to python or just js or just python cli?
* explore minimax and alpha-beta algorithms
* deterministic game
* zero sum game
* only really possible to win or draw, not always win?
* going first increases ability to win
* 8 possible winning combinations

Logic needed
************

* DONE respond to click of space
* DONE determine if move creates win
* DONE prompt user it is their move
* find spots that need to be blocked
* determine next best move (and my god, give it a slight pause)
    - win if possible
    - block win
    - next best move
